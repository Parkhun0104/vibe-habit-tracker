## AI (Gemini CLI) Usage

This project was built with the help of the Gemini CLI, which was used for various tasks, including:

*   **Component Generation:** Gemini was used to generate the initial boilerplate for React components like `HabitForm.jsx`, `HabitList.jsx`, and `FilterButtons.jsx`.
*   **Refactoring:** Gemini was used to refactor components to add new features like state management, props, and responsive design. For example, Gemini helped in refactoring `App.jsx` to include state management for habits, filtering, and `localStorage` persistence.
*   **Debugging:** Gemini was used to identify and fix bugs in the code. For example, Gemini helped in debugging issues with props and state management.

Overall, Gemini was a valuable tool that helped in speeding up the development process and improving the quality of the code.
